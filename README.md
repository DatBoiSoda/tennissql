# tennissql

I have taken the data of tennis matches dating all the way from the start of 2010 and analyzed data providing insights into every player's match statistics who were active at the time. I looked at only stats of the the Big4 tennis - Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, and Andy Murray, and compared them with the rest of the players on tour, or both the groups.

For the purpose of this project, I have used SQL to manipulate data using joins, aggregate functions, and case statements. 

Then I took this data set onto Tableau to create beautiful visualisations.
